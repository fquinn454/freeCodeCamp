                The life and adventures of Bosco, a small red-haired puppet who lives in his "bosca" (Irish for box). Bosco never leaves his box but discovers the world through song and stories contributed by the regular presenters and the daily trip through a "magic door". Bosco has a large number 5 displayed on his box, due to the fact that 5 is his favourite number. Bosco speaks in Irish some of the time, using words familiar to young Irish children.

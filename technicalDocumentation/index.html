User Stories:

You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five
The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")
The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)
The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)
You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section
The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
Your technical documentation should use at least one media query

                </p>
                <p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

                <header><h2>Fixed</h2></header>
                <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
                </p>
                <p>
                A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

                <header><h2>Absolute</h2></header>
                <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

                <p>However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>
                    
                <P>Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.</p>

                <p>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</p>

                    <p>A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</p>

                    <div id="scrollbox">
                        <p>Try to <b>scroll</b> inside this frame to understand how sticky positioning works.</p>

                        <div>I am sticky!</div>

                        <div style="padding-bottom:2000px">
                            <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when you reach its scroll position.</p>
                            <p>Scroll back up to remove the stickyness.</p>
